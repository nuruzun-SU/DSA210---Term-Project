    "### The Relationship Between S&P 500 ESG Scores and Their Stock Prices (Annual Return)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the hypothesis being tested is whether ESG scores influence a company's stock price. The stock price data for the companies starts on January 3, 2023, and ends on August 30, 2024. The ESG scores for the companies were released in September 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    ">To understand the effect of ESG scores on stock prices, two approaches were considered: \n",
    "    - Either using the price difference between the start and end of the period, \n",
    "    - Or calculating the annual return (percentage growth) and using that data. \n",
    "After considering both options, the decision was made to use **annual return** for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price Difference vs. Annual Return\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Price Difference** shows only the absolute change in price.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Company | Start Price | End Price | Price Difference |\n", "\n",
    "   |---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|\n", "\n",
    "   | AAPL    | 150         | 160       | +10 USD          |\n","\n",
    "   | TSLA    | 800         | 810       | +10 USD          |\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, both Apple and Tesla have the same price difference (+10 USD), but the significance of this difference is very different for investors:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For Apple: **+6.67% gain**\n",
    "   - For Tesla: **+1.25% gain**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, **Price Difference** does not account for the size of the company or its stock price!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Annual Return** gives a normalized percentage change in value, allowing for fairer comparisons between companies of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using the same data in terms of annual return:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Company | Start Price | End Price | Annual Return |\n","\n",
    "   |---------|-------------|-----------|---------------|\n","\n",
    "   | AAPL    | 150         | 160       | +6.67%        |\n","\n",
    "   | TSLA    | 800         | 810       | +1.25%        |\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now, the size of the company or stock price is no longer important. The percentage return shows clearly which company has delivered a better return to its investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So, Why Use Annual Return?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It **normalizes** differences between companies of various sizes and stock prices.\n",
    "- It measures **actual investment performance**.\n",
    "- It **standardizes interpretation**: regardless of company size, the percentage return is what's being discussed.\n",
    "- **Statistical comparisons** (like t-tests and correlations) are more **fair and accurate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**: There is no relationship between ESG scores and annual return.\n",
    "- **Hₐ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: There is a relationship between ESG scores and annual return.\n"

    "### Methods Used in This Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics** (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, etc.) were first calculated to get a basic understanding of the data.\n",
    "2. A **histogram** was used to observe the distribution of the data and check for any skewness or outliers in the ESG scores and annual returns.\n",
    "3. A **scatter plot** was then created to visually observe any potential relationship between ESG scores and annual returns.\n",
    "4. Finally, for hypothesis testing, the **Pearson correlation method** was used. This was chosen because Pearson correlation is ideal for measuring the linear relationship between two continuous variables, such as ESG scores and annual returns.\n"
