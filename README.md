# The Relationship Between S&P 500 ESG Performance and Their Stock Value
## Motivation

  Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming more important in investment decisions. Investors and analysts want to understand how ESG performance affects stock prices and long-term financial success. This project will study whether companies with higher ESG scores have better stock performance, lower risk, or higher returns.
  By analyzing the link between ESG performance and stock value in the S&P 500, this research can provide useful insights for investors, financial managers, and policymakers. The goal is to help them make better decisions that balance financial success with sustainability.

## Data Source

The data for this project will come from different financial and ESG rating sources:
  - ### ESG Data:
    ESG scores for S&P 500 companies will be collected from platforms like Refinitiv, MSCI ESG Ratings, or Sustainalytics. These sources provide ESG scores annually or quarterly, along with details on environmental, social, and governance factors.
  - ### Stock Market Data:
    Historical stock prices and financial data will be taken from sources like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or Alpha Vantage. This includes stock returns, market value, and risk levels.

## Merging the Data

To combine ESG and stock data, we need a common key:
  - ### Company Name or Ticker Symbol: 
    Each company in the S&P 500 has a unique ticker symbol, like "AAPL" (Apple) or "GOOGL" (Google). The ESG data should also include these identifiers.
  - ### Date (Timestamp):
    ESG data is usually reported yearly or quarterly, so stock price data must be adjusted to match the same time periods.

By linking ESG scores with stock performance, this study will explore whether strong ESG performance leads to higher stock prices and lower risk. The results may help investors and businesses make smarter ESG-focused investment choices.
